imagine this,

you're a painter
you painted a painting of yourself, of how you see yourself.

literally everyone you've ever met comes to see your painting of yourself. but not everyone had the same interpretation of this painting as you do.

each one has their own [[perspective]], each one has their own spin on things. some people even ask doubts from you when they don't understand. some assume what they want. some only see what they want to see, some make their own conclusions, some makeup their own stories.

but literally no one will see your painting of yourself the exact same way you do. you've tried your best to let others [[see]] the best version of yourself. but even then, people might not always see that.

they might see only your flaws, they might criticise only based on their assumptions.

and that's fine. that's their reality.

but yours, is only that self portrait.
