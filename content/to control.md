to control everything, is substituting freedom for security. you might decide to control something, so that you know all it possible outcomes, like me trying to control [[my thoughts]].

but i can't. and that's the beauty of it. and endless thread of branches on [[a tree]], uncontrollable. 

the lack of control is something i'm getting used to, but something just knowing [[possibilities]] gives me [[hope]], and [[not knowing]] gives me [[fear]].
