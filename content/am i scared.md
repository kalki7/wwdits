yes, ofc, but what am i scared off?

when i was younger, i was scared off being an [[outcast]], then when i started accepting myself (or whatever [[form of self]]), i got scared of losing what i'd gained, i built these structures, these systems that were torn down every 2-3 years by various arcs, and i rebuilt them a little more robust, resilient. rather there's a [[belief]] that it's a little more robust, resilient.

but i'm still constantly scared that the next arc will break it down completely and i won't be able to rebuild it. what will i be [[in the end]]
