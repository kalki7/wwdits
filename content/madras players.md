during the first identity conflict, which was more about the mind and body not agreeing upon certain traits, i discovered theatrics.

a went for a particular workshop which helped me start understanding more about people, i understood defining instruments such as character traits, quirks, dialogue, mood, intent, emote, extra and a lot more. it helped me condense the cloud of confusion in my head when it came to my identity.

i first struggled with the sense of belonging at first and then accepted duality in a sense that i can exist both here and there, i can be both. but that didn't solve the conflicts that the two had.
although it eventually did morph into a single organism, i never dropped the theatrics. so if you find me talking a lot in theatrical terms, you can blame this.
