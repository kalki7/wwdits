hypothetically, if i've gotten everything [[i want]]ed and everything [[i wish]]ed for, would i start feeling something? [[idk]]

feeling something and having something are two separate things. 

you can always see something, hear something, touch something, say something, taste something, so the physical and mental something can be distinguished.

but can a physical something help you find mental something. YES. 100%. if you disagree, kiss someone, you'll [[see]]
