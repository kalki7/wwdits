if you're doing [[something]] for the [[plot]], that isn't enough. you need to control the narrative. but why does it matter? because when you narrate a story, people see it through the [[perspective]] you put them in. you pick the right one, you're the [[protagonist]], pick the wrong one, you're the [[antagonist]].

>whoever controls the narrative, controls the people
