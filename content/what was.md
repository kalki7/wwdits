everything was loud, every sentence, every song. nothing felt gentle. it all felt like it was covered in thorns with no sight of the flowers. it felt like i was in a pit, with no sense of the freshness above, or the coldness below, always in a state of weightless limbo.

there were very few [[things that excited me]], and even they could never hold my attention for prolonged periods. i'd always go back, like a pendulum in an ideal scenario, swinging between opposite directions converting its kinetic energy to potential energy, except that i didn't have any potential nor the energy to do anything.

i had no motivation. and it always baffled me how others were motivated to do anything. when i asked others, what kept them going, the most common answer was the hope of a better tomorrow. that no matter how bad today is, tomorrow will be a little better. the reverse of a [[progressive overload]].

i never had that hope, not in anyone nor in anything.
