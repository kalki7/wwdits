music art dance

music helps me get lost in the moment
art helps me feel the moment
dance helps me be in the moment

but since i suck at all of these, i always dissociate in the moment. i listen to music for the greater part of each day, i keep downloading and collecting random pieces of art, and i watch in awe as people express themselves through movement

at the end, all of these are just way people have expressed themselves. something i kinda suck at. i feel sad, here's music that'll make you feel sad so that you know how i feel. the ability to induce an emotion in someone else is a talent [[i wish]] to have.

but lord knows if i were able to induce what [[i feel]] to others, the outcome would be far less than morally acceptable.
