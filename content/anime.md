i like anime, cause it showed me the cruelty of this world in the most beautiful way possible.

the [[protagonist]] aint right, and the [[antagonist]] aint wrong. it's just their philosophies. their ideas. most movies show absolutes, one is right one is wrong, anime didn't do that. it made me think, it made me consider. it didn't hand me the answer on a platter, it didn't hand me a platter at all. it gave me something to think about. and that's beautiful.
