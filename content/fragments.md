ever since the movie Inside Out, i've always been visualising the inside of my head in a very similar fashion, but instead of emotions, i've got fully fleshed out characters roaming around.

the human brain is effectively just a collection of material, chemicals and electricity. with a certain combination of things in certain places makes us feel and think certain things. but that definition never kinda helped me understand the problem of personas that i've dealt with.

it started with languages where i'd mimic a telugu reddy and a tamil brahmin when switching in and out of my multilingual home. which only got worse when english and hindi started seeping in. as every brain starts with a clean slate, to embody these personas i started off with copying actors from movies, copied certain dialogues to actions to traits. (all this just to not feel like an [[outcast]] anywhere)

the dialogues were the easy part, but when it came to actions, my body found it a lot harder to adapt. between a tamil brahmin gagging just at the thought of consuming anything that wasn't a plant, to a telugu reddy who had to consume everything that wasn't a plant, my body couldn't really adapt all that well. to the point where my telugu identity started having a crisis, but the tamil was fine.

and as the years went by, both the tamil and telugu characters merged into a malformed child of the south with just a whole array of traits I'd picked along the way that I thought were either cool or helped me through a situation.

i finally understood what [[i am]]
but i still struggled with what [[i feel]]
