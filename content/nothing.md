what is nothing,

is it the presence of nothing,
or the lack of presence of [[something]]

in that case what's something?

i'd say nothing is a void, it's empty, it's not black, black is a colour, it's something, it's not a black hole, a black hole sucks something into it with a considerable amount of time dilation around it due to its mass singularity and how that affects space time around it

you can feel something, you can't feel nothing, so then what do [[i feel]], the lack of something

but which [[something]] is lacking?
