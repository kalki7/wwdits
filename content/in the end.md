so what is at the end? no one knows

i once believed i could choose my end, but it didn't really go as planned. actually it didn't go as planned for 8 times.

when you've tried to quit something for 8 times and have failed each time, i think it's time to quit quitting and just accept [[it is what it is]]

but if you still choose to not agree with reality, is it really better to just sit around waiting for the end to come? *no*

>so what are you going to do about it?
