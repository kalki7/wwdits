[[nothing]], lol

i've effectively reverse engineered feelings, people feel and then act upon said feeling. since i don't know what feels, i just copy an action and then the induced feeling, i map with the original feeling.

if someone is sad, they can cry. therefore whenever someone cries we can deduce that they're sad, in a sort of 1:n emotion to action mapping. therefore when i'm [[supposed]] to feel sad, i start crying first and then whatever i feel (kinda) at that point, i've labelled that as sadness for myself.

so i feel, just differently.
