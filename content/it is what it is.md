acceptance vs denial

a very interesting topic as people chose what they want to accept and deny. if society were to work on a scientific basis for any sort of reasoning or logic, empirical data, proof, etc. we'd be in a very different setup.

that's because acceptance doesn't truly require logic, it required [[belief]]. you first need to believe what's in front of you to accept it.

what we see hear taste feel smell are all just electrical signals sent to the brain and the brain reconstructs a version of reality in your head. so we choose to believe that the version of reality we have is true.

so if you believe in an idea strong enough, you can share [[your reality]] how ever you'd like.
