unhinged, random, annoying, irritating, questionable.

why do i even have thoughts. why do i think? i hate thinking. i hate [[overthinking]].

descartes said, i think therefore i am, so thinking proves i exist
kandel said, i am there for i think, so existing produces thought

one makes being the end, the other makes thinking a symptom.

i want to not be and to not thing, so wtf do i do. maybe [[take it slow]]?
