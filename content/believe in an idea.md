i believe in an idea that sort of defines fundamentally who i am. this idea is stolen from almost all [[anime]] that's ever existed, and that's probably why i stole it in the first place.

>you can always be better

anime is fundamentally based on how the [[protagonist]] fights the [[antagonist]], two ideas clash and they both evolve during this conflict. The hero empathises with the villain, and the villain understands the hero. They have a moment of bromance, before finally concluding that they both can't exist.

believing in [[something]] just helps in general, gives [[hope]]
