now how does one know what they're supposed to do, what they're supposed to feel, what they're supposed to say

how do we even know what is supposedly expected from us at a given situation. imagine you're watching a movie, the antagonist is holding a hostage, and he's willing to let go of the hostage if he gets a pack of gum. the protagonist gives him a pack of gun, so now the antagonist is  supposed to let go of the hostage, but no, the hostage is shot dead. wait he wasn't supposed to do that, but you're just a viewer, you have no control over what's going on in the movie, according to the writer, the antagonist was supposed to do that. so now who's right? neither, you had an expectation of how the writer would take the story, the story didn't go the way you expected, so you're either shocked or let down (writers usually want the first one).

but reality isn't a movie, due to society, there are a lot of things that we consider normal and that normal defines what we're supposed to do.

so to feel less like an [[outcast]], i just copy what people are supposed to do, hoping that i'll feel that people are supposed to feel. but how do i know what i'm supposed to do, [[madras players]] helped me out on that one.

> the world is a stage, if you don't have the script, improv such that you don't throw off your fellow actors

so just notice how others are acting and build your acting from there.
