i get more comfortable with my experiences the more i relive them. but that doesn't mean i want to relive all of them. and this is one such, in an attempt to feel [[something]].

so months ago, signed up for a boxing bootcamp, why? for the [[plot]]. in a gist, i signed up to train and fight someone.

what was i thinking when i signed up? oh cool, this is going to be awesome.

on the day of the fight? shitting bricks, woke up early, anxious to the point where i didn't stop sweating through the night. constantly doubting and debating with myself, you can skip, it's fine no one cares. but no, you did sign up for it, just go, what's the worst that can happen. what's the worst that can happen. what's the worst that can happen?

the mid of the holiday season meant i was literally going alone, the venue reminded me of annual day from school. whole lot of people, heavy crowd, there were participants and each participant had 5 people them. i hated the fact i went alone, it was awkward from the beginning, just sitting alone, walking around alone with my earphones on the whole time. why was i doing this to myself. after registration, i did puked out of anxiety. it wasn't fun.

post my bathroom escapade, i'd came out and finally caught a glance at my opponent. nothing too scary, just very lanky, i was less worried about him and more about myself. my brain was my own enemy. so. many. thoughts. why am i doing this, why am i still doing this, is this right, is it wrong, violence is wrong, but this is consensual violence. just debating with myself entirely.

and when i thought shit couldn't get any worse it did. it was time to move towards the ring. and my legs were trembling.
