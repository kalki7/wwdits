based on [[narrative]], we all choose what we want to see hear etc. why do we do this?

to avoid the harder questions in life. you might see grass and call it green, but a colour blind person might see it as red. unless you see it from their perspective, you won't [[understand]] them.

perspectives matter, it's the same story from a different dimension. we all know 2d, 3d, etc, but stories have n-dimensions. everyone story affects everyone differently.

if you're the [[protagonist]] of your story, that is your perspective. but in your own story, someone else might see you as the [[antagonist]], that i their perspective.

but then, who is [[right or wrong]]
