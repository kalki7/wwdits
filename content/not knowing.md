if you're [[sick]], you have a lot of symptoms of sickness, from which you can deduce what illness you have. once you know [[you're ill]] and what is making you ill, you'll take medication, precautions to get better.

the key aspect here being that based on your [[symptoms]] you're able to identify your illness. but if you're unable to figure out what's wrong. trail and error of assuming that it's something, treating for it, failing, and repeating this loop endlessly.

the [[fear]] of not knowing what's made you sick sits in.

this is not a nice feeling.
