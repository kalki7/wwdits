i wish i didn't want to not exist
i wish i had an emotional support system
i wish that each time i had a thought i didn't start overthinking it immediately
i wish i was at peace
i wish i knew how to find peace
i wish i knew that peace was

but we don't always get what we wished for. but in my case, i've never gotten anything that i've wished for. doesn't mean i'm going to stop wishing. wishing is free
