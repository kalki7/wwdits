what is a belief? acceptance, conviction, faith. by believing in something, it becomes a belief.

i believe that the world is round, how do i believe it? by reading articles, looking at various factual proofs and theorems and even performing the candle experiment on my own.

but then how do some people believe that the world is flat? they've just accepted it as a fact by faith. but them how strong (and maybe blind) must one's faith in something be to just accept it?

i was once told that a good book is defined by it's writer and it's reader, the writer is trying to convey something, but it's upto the reader to interpret it to the best of his capabilities. you need be able to understand art to appreciate it, you need to have a palette to appreciate caviar.

similarly, apart from looking at those who preach that we world is flat, we also need to look at those who accept it.

if we can look at belief as not just right and wrong, but try to understand how the preacher and the believer are both functioning, to truly how people believe.
