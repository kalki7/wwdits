i want to die

there's a constant misconception here about people who wish to kill themselves. it's not because they want to die, it's because they want to never be born. i didn't want to kms to enjoy death, but to rather stop the suffering that i was already going through. rather than sit through agony each day, i thought one short quick swipe, skid, swallow or swing would be a lot better.

i wanted to give up everything i had, i experienced (which wasn't a lot tbh) only because i was unable to handle [[what was]].

i did try a couple, but nothing really worked out.
