when does thinking end and overthinking start? is there like a threshold of some measurable quantity that i can track. so if it gets too high, i can know i'm overthinking and stop.

what is overthinking, when you think more than what is normally required. but [[idk]] what's normally required, so am i always overthinking or underthinking?
