so my history with boxing starts with a 10th std crush absolutely loving this, and me making an attempt just to get closer to her. she had a very interesting [[philosophy]] to this.

once you're in the ring, you're there for blood. you don't hesitate, you don't show doubt, remorse, mercy, or anything. you don't stop unless you're told. by the doctor, the referee, your coach. it's the system's job to handle rules, safety, etc. the system shall do its job. you do yours. beat the living daylights out of the other guy and don't stop.

her logic was kind of sound, but reasoning? cause it's fun
