lethargy can be a symptom for a lot of things, and usually like how elders say, oh you have a fever? have a dolo, without diagnosing the true problem of an infection, or an allergy or whatever.

when people are lethargic, they just say STOP BEING LAZY. without trying to understand the underlying reason as to why they're like that in the first place.

and whenever people called me lethargic, [[sh]] would kick me right out of it for a brief period.
